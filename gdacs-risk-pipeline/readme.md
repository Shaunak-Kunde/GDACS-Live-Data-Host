I am working on a Supply Chain Management Project. I am doing a geospatial Risk analysis. I am mapping Site Names/Supplier locations to-Natural Disasters and Risks.

I accessed the publicly available live disaster data from gdacs.org.
I saved it as .geojson file.
Then I used a python script to split it into individual .geojson files for each disaster likeearthquake, cyclone, etc.
Then I hosted those .geojosn files into this Github repository.
I used github actions and a .yml script to dynamically update these files for a scheduled refresh.
Then I used the Azure Map Reference layer URL otion inside Power BI to visualise these disasters with respect to my site location.
This helps us know in real time basis the live natural disaster risk aspect for each supplier location, hence we can plan our procurements and sourcing accordingly.

Example:

and:

etc.
